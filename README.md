# Weather-Forecast-Predictor
In this project we are using the dataset taken from Kaggle for making analysis with different data mining approaches on weather forecast. 
At first, we visualize the data set and try to find if there is any specific kind of noise as well as outliers. Then we preprocess the data and after that we have tried to fit our model with different classifier for getting a prediction result so that we can evaluate our model. A small glimpse of time series is also applied at the end of the project for getting or analyzing the attributes like temperature (c), summary, wind speed with apparent temperature. we have used matrix profile for getting the normalized values and after that applied discords and trying to find if there are any anomalies on that specific attributes. we have found anomalies in each attribute we were using during applying the matrix profile. In future we would like to build a model which could predict weather for a specific place based on previous data.

This dataset contains historical daily weather data for Leeds, England from Jan 1st, 2006, to Dec 31st, 2016.
This dataset was taken from Kaggle website. Below is the given link:

12 Attributes (Formatted Date, Summary, Precip Type, Temperature (C), Apparent Temperature (C), Humidity, Wind Speed (km/h), Wind Bearing (degrees), Visibility (km), Loud Cover, Pressure (millibars), Daily Summary)
